This challenge of the bootcamp was to create a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS using third party API.<br><br>
The weather dashboard has the following functionality:<br>

<li>There is a search bar on the dashboard where a user can input a city which will show current weather info.<br>
<li>Weather information like temperature, humidity, windspeed, uvIndex is fetched from the openweathermap API.<br>
<li>The uvindex changes from green, yellow, or red based on how favorable the weather condition is.<br>
<li>There is a five day forceast for the selected city which shows all pertinent weather data.<br>
<li>Under the search bar there is search history of cities that is retrieved from local storage.<br><br>
